Overview
As a software engineer, I wanted to practice building something useful and interactive while learning core C++ skills. I created a Flashcard Math Quiz Game that lets users study using custom question-and-answer cards.

This software demonstrates my understanding of functions, loops, conditionals, classes, and file handling in C++. I also used STL vectors to store flashcards in a dynamic way.

My goal with this project was to get more confident writing C++ code and to understand how to read and write data to a file using file streams.

Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code to write and test the program. I compiled the C++ code in terminal. 

The programming language I used was C++. I also used the Standard Template Library (STL), specifically vector, string, and fstream.

Future Work
Add randomization to quiz questions

Show score as a percentage and offer feedback
